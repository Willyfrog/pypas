## Summary

-hy- Python pastebin clone along the lines of ix.io

# History

This is a fork from [Pastas](http://github.com/Willyfrog/pastas) which is
currently being used at work for passing along snippets of code and general text.

Some coworkers wanted to contribute and knew Python, but where *afraid* of Hy's
lispy syntax, so this fork was born.

It is also an exercise on how easy is to migrate from a Hy application into a
Python one. An I must say it is pretty easy!
